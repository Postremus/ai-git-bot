/**
 * A webhook after provider translation: what happened, the provider-neutral payload,
 * and the facts about the bot that only the provider can establish.
 * <p>
 * Translators fill in every bot-relative fact ({@code fromBot}, {@code botIsReviewer},
 * {@code botIsAssignee}, {@code botMentioned}) because matching the bot's identity differs per provider —
 * a login on Gitea/GitHub/GitLab, an {@code account_id} on Bitbucket, a
 * {@code uniqueName} on Azure DevOps. The dispatcher never inspects raw payloads
 * or compares users itself.
 *
 * @param kind          what happened
 * @param payload       the translated payload; {@code null} only for {@link WebhookEventKind#IGNORED}
 * @param fromBot       the event was triggered by the bot itself and must not be acted on
 * @param botIsReviewer the bot is currently among the pull request's requested reviewers
 * @param botIsAssignee the bot is currently among the pull request's assignees
 * @param botMentioned  the comment body addresses the bot (only meaningful for comment kinds)
 * @param botAlias      the readable alias the bot is addressed by, e.g. {@code @claude_bot};
 *                      Bitbucket rewrites its {@code @{account_id}} markup to this before
 *                      the payload reaches the dispatcher
 * @param ignoreReason  why the event is ignored, for logging; only set for {@link WebhookEventKind#IGNORED}
