/**
 * Collapses the burst of webhooks a provider fires for one user action into a single
 * automatic review.
 * <p>
 * Opening a pull request with the bot as assignee or reviewer makes GitHub and Gitea send
 * {@code opened} together with {@code assigned} and/or {@code review_requested}. Each of
 * them asks for a review of the same commit, and they arrive within seconds, in no
 * guaranteed order and processed concurrently. Without this, every one of them would start
 * its own review and post its own comments.
 * <p>
 * An automatic review is therefore claimed per bot, pull request and head commit: the first
 * trigger wins, and further triggers for the same commit within {@link #WINDOW} are
 * dropped. The window is short on purpose — a reviewer re-requested minutes later is a
 * deliberate ask and is honoured — and closing the pull request ends it ({@link #forget}),
 * so a pull request reopened at the same commit is reviewed again. A payload without a head
 * sha is never debounced, and an explicit "review again" comment does not go through here.
 * <p>
 * The state is in-memory and per node, like {@link org.remus.giteabot.event.PullRequestStateTracker}:
 * events of one burst spread over several instances are not collapsed.
