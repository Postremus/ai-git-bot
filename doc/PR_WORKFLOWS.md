# PR Workflows

A **PR workflow** is an automated task the bot runs on a pull request. Each
workflow solves one recurring engineering chore — reviewing the diff, writing
tests, keeping docs current — so it happens on every PR without anyone
remembering to do it.

This guide is problem-first: find the chore you want to automate, read what the
workflow does, then follow the shared setup steps at the bottom. You do **not**
need to understand the bot's internals to use any of them.

---

## Which problem do you want to solve?

| I want to… | Use the workflow | Key | Default? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Get every PR reviewed with inline feedback | **[PR Review](PR_WORKFLOWS_REVIEW.md)** | `review` | ✅ On |
| Get a deeper review where the bot reads the surrounding code first | **[Agentic PR Review](PR_WORKFLOWS_AGENTIC_REVIEW.md)** | `agentic-review` | Opt-in |
| Automatically add unit tests for the changed code | **[Unit Tests](PR_WORKFLOWS_UNIT_TEST.md)** | `unit-test-author` | Opt-in |
| Generate and run end-to-end browser tests against a live preview | **[Full-Stack QA](PR_WORKFLOWS_E2E.md)** | `e2e-test` | Opt-in |
| Keep the README and docs in sync with the code | **[README Sync](PR_WORKFLOWS_README_SYNC.md)** | `readme-sync` | Opt-in |
| Keep translations in sync across locale files | **[i18n Coverage](PR_WORKFLOWS_I18N_COVERAGE.md)** | `i18n-coverage` | Opt-in |

Every workflow posts its result as a comment on the pull request. Only
**PR Review** is on by default; the rest are opt-in per bot.

> **PR vs. issue workflows:** the configurations on this page drive
> pull-request events only. What a bot does when it is *assigned to an
> issue* is configured separately through its **Issue-Assigned Workflow
> Configuration** — see [Issue-Assigned Workflows](ISSUE_WORKFLOWS.md). Both

## Setting up and running a workflow

The setup is the same for every workflow. You do it once per bot in the admin
web UI.

### 1. Choose a workflow configuration

A **workflow configuration** is a reusable, named set of workflows plus their
per-workflow settings. You assign one configuration to a bot; many bots can
share the same configuration.

Go to **System settings → Workflow configurations**. You can:

- use the seeded **`Default`** configuration (runs only **PR Review**),
- clone it and tick the extra workflows you want, or
- create a new configuration from scratch.

On the **Workflows for «name»** page, tick each workflow you want and fill in
its settings. Each workflow renders as a collapsible section with its own
fields; the defaults are sensible, so you can enable a workflow without
changing anything.

### 2. Assign the configuration to a bot

Go to **Bots → New / Edit bot → Workflow Configuration** and pick your
configuration (or leave **(use default)** to inherit `Default`).

### 3. Decide when it should run

On the bot form, the following settings control automatic triggering on a new pull
request:

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Bot is requested as reviewer | Always on | Runs when the PR is opened with the bot as a reviewer, or when a developer requests the bot as a reviewer later. |
| Bot is assigned to the PR | Always on | Runs when the PR is opened with the bot as an assignee, or when the bot is assigned to the PR later (Gitea, GitHub, GitLab). |
| **Run workflow when PR is opened** | Off | Runs on every new or reopened PR, no reviewer request needed. |
| **Run workflow when PR head is updated** | Off | Runs configured workflows whenever new commits are pushed to the PR branch. Title and description edits, label changes and reviewer votes do not count. |
| **Branch Filter** | Blank (all refs allowed) | Restricts triggering to PRs whose target (base) branch matches the comma-separated glob list — e.g. `releases/*` runs workflows only on PRs into a release branch. A non-matching PR is ignored — no workflow, no PR comment — and the skip is logged at `INFO`. |

Opening a PR with the bot as reviewer or assignee makes most providers send several
events at once (opened, review requested, assigned). They all ask for the same commit, so
only the first one starts a run; further automatic triggers for that commit within a
minute are dropped. An explicit "review again" comment always runs.

Turn on **Run workflow when PR is opened** if you want a workflow to run for
every PR unconditionally.

**Branch Filter** *(optional)* is an allow-list, not a toggle: when it is
**blank or `*`, every branch and tag is allowed** and triggering behaves exactly
as before. To restrict workflows to specific branches, enter a comma-separated
list of [gobwas/glob](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile)
patterns (e.g. `develop,feature/*,hotfix/*`). `*` matches any run of characters
**including `/`, so `feature/*` also matches `feature/a/b`; `?` matches a single
character; `[abc]` / `[a-z]` are character classes; `{a,b}` is alternation. To
match full ref names, prefix with `refs/heads/` or `refs/tags/` (e.g.
`refs/heads/develop` or `refs/tags/v*`). This is useful for branch-based
workflows (e.g. git-flow) where the bot should only act on PRs targeting certain
branches: the filter is matched against the PR's target (base) branch, falling
back to the source (head) branch only when no base ref is present. The filter only
affects whether a PR workflow *starts*; it does not change the workflow's
behaviour once it runs, and it does not affect issue/agent workflows.

#### Triggers per Git provider

Every provider's webhooks go through the same rules, so the settings above mean the same
thing everywhere. What differs is which events a provider can send at all:

| Trigger | Gitea | GitHub | GitLab | Bitbucket Cloud | Azure DevOps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR opened | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| New commits pushed (**Run workflow when PR head is updated**) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ ¹ | ✅ ¹ |
| Bot requested as reviewer after the PR was opened | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ ¹ | ✅ ¹ |
| Bot assigned to the PR | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| PR reopened | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ (reactivated) ¹ |
| PR closed or merged (ends the bot's session for the PR) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Comment or inline code comment mentioning the bot | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ ² | ✅ |
| "Review again" comment from the PR author | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Review submitted on the PR | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Issue assigned to the bot, issue opened, issue comment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |

¹ Bitbucket Cloud and Azure DevOps send one "pull request updated" event for pushes,
edits, reviewer changes and votes alike, without saying what changed. The bot tells them
apart by comparing each event with the previous one it saw for that PR. That memory is
not kept across restarts: the first event for an existing PR after a restart counts as a
push, and — when the bot is a listed reviewer — as a review request, so it can cause one
extra review per PR, but never a missed one. The other providers mark pushes themselves:
Gitea and GitHub with a `synchronized`/`synchronize` action, GitLab with `oldrev`.

² Mentions must be picked from Bitbucket's `@` autocomplete; see
[Bitbucket Setup](BITBUCKET_SETUP.md).

A comment that mentions the bot on a PR the bot created from an issue continues that
issue's agent session; on any other PR it runs the matching slash command, or the review
when no command matches. Who may trigger the bot from a PR comment depends on the kind of
comment and on the bot's **User Whitelist**:

| Comment mentioning the bot | Without a whitelist | With a whitelist |
|---|---|---|
| Conversation comment | Anyone | The listed users |
| Inline code comment | The PR author | The PR author, if listed |
| "Review again" | The PR author | The PR author, if listed |

### 4. (Optional) trigger it by hand

Some workflows also respond to a comment command on the PR:

| Command | Workflow |
|---|---|
| `@bot generate-tests` / `@bot rerun-unit-tests` | Unit Tests |
| `@bot regenerate-tests [feedback]` / `@bot rerun-tests` | Full-Stack QA |
| `@bot regenerate-readme [instruction]` | README Sync |
| `@bot regenerate-i18n [instruction]` | i18n Coverage |

The exact commands are documented on each workflow's own page.

---

## What you see while it runs

- The bot reacts to a triggering command with a 👀 and posts a short "starting"
  comment, so you know it picked up the work.
- When finished, it posts a result comment (review findings, a test-run table,
  a documentation-change summary, …).
- If a new push updates the PR while an older run of the same workflow is still
  going, the older run is cancelled so its comments never race against stale
  code.

Run status and steps are also visible in the admin UI where supported, and in
the application logs.

---

## Upgrade behaviour

Existing installations are migrated to a `Default` workflow configuration that
contains only **PR Review**, preserving previous behaviour. Review-category
workflows may be added to `Default` automatically on upgrade; all testing and
documentation workflows are opt-in. Bots with no explicit configuration inherit
`Default`.

---

## Per-workflow guides

- [PR Review](PR_WORKFLOWS_REVIEW.md) — the default one-shot review.
- [Agentic PR Review](PR_WORKFLOWS_AGENTIC_REVIEW.md) — review after the bot
  explores the codebase.
- [Unit Tests](PR_WORKFLOWS_UNIT_TEST.md) — generate and run unit tests.
- [Full-Stack QA](PR_WORKFLOWS_E2E.md) — generate and run E2E browser tests.
- [README Sync](PR_WORKFLOWS_README_SYNC.md) — keep documentation current.

## Audit trail

Every workflow run produces a tamper-evident audit trail. The bot records
lifecycle events, tool calls the AI agent makes, step-level progress, and
review decisions in a hash-chained append-only log. You can use this to
reconstruct exactly what happened during a workflow run, verify that no events
were inserted or deleted, and correlate AI interactions with token usage.

### What gets recorded

| Event | Emitted when |
|---|---|
| `PR_WORKFLOW_RUN_STARTED` | A workflow starts for a pull request. |
| `PR_WORKFLOW_STEP_APPENDED` | A workflow records a named step (e.g. `fetch-diff`). |
| `TOOL_CALL_EXECUTED` | The AI agent calls a tool during an agentic workflow. Stores the tool name, arguments (truncated to 2 KB), result excerpt (1 KB), success flag, round number, duration, and token counts. |
| `PR_WORKFLOW_RUN_COMPLETED` | A workflow finishes (SUCCESS, FAILED, or CANCELLED). |
| `REVIEW_COMPLETED` | A review-category workflow posts its review to the PR. |

Every event carries the bot ID, repository, PR number, run ID, and a UTC
timestamp. Tool-call events also include `ai_session_id` and
`ai_usage_session_id` for cross-referencing with the AI usage log and session
tables.

### Hash chain integrity

Events are linked by a SHA-256 hash chain scoped to each workflow run.
The first event in a run has `previous_hash = NULL`; every subsequent event's
hash is computed from the previous event's hash, the event type, timestamp,
and the canonical JSON payload:

```
hash = SHA-256(event_type | timestamp_ms | payload_json | previous_hash)
```

To verify integrity, recompute each event's hash from its predecessor.
A break in the chain means an event was inserted, deleted, or altered.

### Querying audit events

Audit events are stored in the `pr_audit_events` table. From a SQL client:

```sql
-- All events for a specific workflow run
SELECT * FROM pr_audit_events WHERE run_id = 42 ORDER BY id;

-- All events for a bot/repo/PR combination
SELECT * FROM pr_audit_events
WHERE bot_id = 1 AND repo_owner = 'acme' AND repo_name = 'api' AND pr_number = 27
ORDER BY id;

-- All tool calls made during a run
SELECT * FROM pr_audit_events
WHERE run_id = 42 AND event_type = 'TOOL_CALL_EXECUTED'
ORDER BY id;
```

The event's `event_payload_json` column contains type-specific details —
arguments, status, summaries — as a flat JSON object.

### Retention policy

Audit events accumulate over time. A nightly garbage collector removes events
older than the configured retention window. By default, events are kept for
**90 days** and the collector runs at **04:23 UTC**.

Configure these in `application.properties` or via environment variables:

| Property | Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit.retention` | `AUDIT_RETENTION` | `P90D` | ISO-8601 duration to keep events (e.g. `P180D`, `P365D`). |
| `audit.gc-cron` | `AUDIT_GC_CRON` | `0 23 4 * * *` | Cron expression for the retention cleanup job. |

In Docker Compose, set them under the `app` service's `environment`:

```yaml
environment:
  AUDIT_RETENTION: P180D
  AUDIT_GC_CRON: "0 0 3 * * *"
```

To disable retention entirely (keep events forever), set `audit.retention` to
a very large value such as `P36500D`. There is no off switch — the collector
always runs but won't delete anything if the cutoff never passes.
